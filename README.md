# Connect Z

### For running program

```
python connectz.py file_path
```

### For running tests

```
python -m unittest discover
```

### How I create the project

I started by creating some simple cases on paper to have a better understanding of the algorithm.
I wrote tests and test cases for these simple tests and passed its to green.

I created a script called "massive file generator" to generate big files and test my program.
At the end, I made a profiling on my program and optimize some parts ( ex : using a generator rather than a list for lines ).

### To improve

Use data structure to save memory
Replace list by set when unique elements
Search lines with neighbours

### Enjoy !
